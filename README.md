LearnTrack helps you build learning habits, track progress, and celebrate consistency.  
Whether you're learning Swift or painting, you’ll *see* your journey bloom through color-coded days.

## 🎯 Core Idea

- Each day you either **Learn** 🧡 or **Freeze** 🩵  
- A **Mini Calendar** visualizes your week  
- A **Goal System** keeps you focused  
- A **Completion Overlay** celebrates your milestones
